				<h1>Goku is about that life on god!</h1>

				<p>
					Hello hello and welcome back! This is yet another one written as always by yours truly and today we will be going over Son Goku and why he like that. As always imma give you the truth and nothing but the truth. No BS. And with the intro outa the way let us begin.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					So we will start with how all great stories start. From the begining. So we finna be covering DBS for this one and maybe i'll do a DBZ one later on but for now it's just DBS. When we first introduced to beerus goku is told by kin kai that "ay cuz the nigga das gonna pull up soon soon is a god, so don't run the hands with him coz he gonna fold you." And usually in other shows where they introduce a new character who is strong as fuck, the main cast is usually scared. Goku? wanted to run the hands with him even more. He is like a child who you tell not to do something, and he just goes and does it anyway. So beerus eventually pulls up and goku like "ay my man, i'm told u is a god and all and i assume that means you strong. So square up!". Nigga literally told a god to square up giving zero fucks in the process. Obviously beerus was not having it and had to drop goku real quick. So we in episode 3 of an anime, and goku already throwing hands with gods.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Anyway let us move on. We move to the goku black arc and just look at black. He is dripped out as fuck. The elegance, the simplicity, just wow. And that is obviously not the point of this post so let us continue. Quick question, if you ever went to another universe what would be the first thing that you do? Well imma tell you what goku did. He went to another universe to run the hands with a deity. Imagine just chilling in a whole different universe and then some dum dum in an orange jumpsuit pulls up and jumps you. And obviously being a deity he was not having it at all(Zamasu is kinda of a sore loser man) and he made a wish to swap bodies with goku. He took the "if you can't beat them, join them" wayy to seriously. Now goku black pulls up in the present time and goku behaved like goku. He did not care how there was another version of him standing right in front of him, he just wanted to run the hands with him. He wants to make sure that even his copy can run the hands. Y'all know that thing where they like this man's hands are rated E for everyone, goku is that guy. In all the movies i've seen about where they make a double of you, the person who they make a double of is usually scared and losing his shit. Goku doesn't care bout none of that.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you thought that was it with goku wanting to run the hands with deity's who can fold him, yeah no. We is introduced to 2 new people. The grand priest and the omni king. So obviously from a visual standpoint they don't look all that much. Now we must remeber that goku still can't beat beerus, any of the angels and he like "ay whis, look at this little nigga. U think i can take him?" and whis just look at him like "is this nigga serious? Goku do not and i repeat do not run the hands with this man!" Goku my boi, you where there when we were writing the anime rules, THE LESS INTIMIDATING THEY LOOK, THEY STRONG AS FUCK. Bruh goku is built like that. This man is a damn demon. He might be an even bigger threat to our universe that all our bad guys combined
				</p>

					Anyway that is all i got for today coz if i continue further, this might be a lot longer than it has too. As always it was a pleasure and remember to sign up and imma see you on the next. :)
